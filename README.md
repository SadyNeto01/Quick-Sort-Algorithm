# Quick Sort Algorithm
 This Java program is an implementation of the QuickSort algorithm for sorting an array of integers. Additionally, the code identifies the most frequently occurring number in the sorted array without using a separate array. The program prompts the user to input the size and values of the array, performs the QuickSort algorithm, prints the sorted array, and identifies the most frequent number along with its count. The code features a clear structure, comments explaining key functions, and a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for learning and understanding both QuickSort and a practical application related to frequency analysis in sorted data.
